# BBEdit Launcher

A simple menubar app that lets you add folders to be opened by BBEdit. I'm using this instead of project files to avoid BBEdit's workspace feature which seems to have weird pauses from time to time while it syncs things in the background.

At least, I _think_ that's what's going on.

Regardless, the app is more convenient than a dock folder, which doesn't work for plain old directories.
