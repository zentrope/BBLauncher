# BB Launcher

A simple menubar app that lets you add folders to be opened by one of your applications, presumably a code editor.

The app is more convenient than a dock folder, which doesn't work for plain old directories, and more convenient (to me) than a giant Shortcuts app.

Originally, this was for launching folders in BBEdit, but the glitchy beach balls I'm getting from that app on macOS 26.x aren't from using BBEdit's project feature, it's just BBEdit, somehow. Other apps and editors don't have the same issue. Therefore, the launcher can launch, say, Nova or CotEditor.
